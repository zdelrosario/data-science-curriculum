# data-science-curriculum

This is a curriculum of **open-source** data science exercises, intended to take a student from zero coding experience to basic data science literacy. These exercises are heavily inspired by the (discontinued) [Data Challenge Lab](https://dcl-docs.stanford.edu/home/) at Stanford University and rely on the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

Please see our [JOSE paper](https://jose.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/jose.00117) for more info.

## How to Use This Repo

1. (Setup) Complete [this exercise](https://zdelrosario.github.io/data-science-curriculum/setup-rstudio.html) to install RStudio.
2. (Setup) Download and unzip [this archive](https://github.com/zdelrosario/data-science-curriculum/archive/refs/heads/build.zip) to obtain the curriculum materials.
3. (Setup) Open the folder you unzipped as a project in RStudio (`File > Open Project...`).
4. (Learn) Work through the exercise files in the `exercises_sequenced/` folder at your own pace to learn data science skills.
5. (Learn) Use the challenges in the `challenges/` folder to put your new skills to use.

**Suggested order**: The exercises filenames start with a numerical `dXY` prefix to denote
their suggested day-order. This is provided to
[interleave](https://academicaffairs.arizona.edu/l2l-strategy-interleaving)
topics and provide about an hour of work per day. I recommend working 5 days a
week on the exercises and taking weekends off!

## Course Description

Data Science is a powerful toolkit to extract usable insights from data. In this class, you will learn tools and gain understanding. You will use software tools to *liberate* data from published images and tables, wrangle messy datasets into machine learning (ML)-ready form, fit and interpret ML models, and visualize to extract meaning. You will also speak the language of uncertainty---statistics---to avoid getting fooled by models. You will criticize published findings and ask what is, and what is not, in the data. Assignments will include regular practice exercises, progressively puzzling real-data challenges, and a final project of your choice where you obtain, wrangle, and understand a dataset.
