*Purpose*: Most real problems have multiple sources of uncertainty mixed
together. Untangling these different sources can be challenging, even on
a conceptual level. In this challenge we'll study a simple problem of
structural safety, and use this small case study to untangle sources of
sampling and Monte Carlo uncertainty.

*Note*: In this challenge I provide a lot of stub-code; you won't have
to do too much coding. This is because I want you to *focus on answering
the conceptual questions*. The most important questions in this
challenge are: *What sources of uncertainty are you accounting for? What
sources are you not accounting for? Are those sources real or induced?*

# Setup

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

```{r setup}
library(MASS)
library(rsample)
library(broom)
library(tidyverse)
filename_samples <- "./data/al_samples.csv"

```

*Background*: The
[strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tensile_strength) of a
material is the amount of mechanical stress it can survive before
breaking. To illustrate: Stresses are internal forces that hold an
object together when we try to squeeze, stretch, or otherwise deform a
solid object. For instance, if we pull on a rectangular bar of material,
internal stresses $\sigma$ work to keep the bar together.

*Strength* is a measure of how much internal stress an object can survive: A higher strength means a stronger material. This challenge's data are very simple: They are (synthetic) observations of ultimate tensile strength (UTS) on individual samples of the same aluminum alloy.

### Important assumptions

For the purposes of this challenge, you should make the following assumptions about the data:

- The experiments were carried out following the highest standards of experimental rigor, so you should consider the values in the dataset to be the "true" breaking strength for each sample.
- The manufacturing process that generated the materials is stable, so you should assume the distribution if fixed. Namely, there is no change in the mean, variance, or other statistics of the distribution of `strength`.

```{r read-data}
## NOTE: No need to edit; load data
df_samples <- read_csv(filename_samples)
df_samples
```

### **q1** Visualize the strength data with a histogram. Answer the questions below.

```{r q1-task}
```

    -   (Your response here)
-   To what extent can you tell what shape the distribution of the data
    has?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Assuming the scopus is the strength of an individual part made from
    this aluminum alloy, is the observed variability real or induced?

# Assessing Structural Safety

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

*Objective*: In this challenge you are going to study a structure and
assess its *probability of failure* (POF). A higher POF corresponds to a
more unsafe structure. Ultimately, we want

$$\text{POF} < 0.03.$$

Your job is to assess a given structure using the data provided and
determine whether you can *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`.

## Structural model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

The following code chunk sets up a structural model: We are considering
a rectangular bar under uniaxial tensile load (as pictured above). A
larger cross-sectional area `A` is capable of surviving a greater load
`L`, but a larger `A` is a heavier (more expensive) structure. The
internal stress is approximately `sigma = L / A`---we simply compare
this quantity against the strength.

I pick particular values for `A, L` and package all the information in
the *limit state function* `g_break`:

```{r model-setup}
## NOTE: No need to edit; model setup
A <- 0.0255 # Cross-sectional area
L <- 1000 # Applied load (lbs)

g_break <- function(strength) {
  strength - L / A
}
```

The *probability of failure* (POF) is then defined in terms of the limit
state $g$ via:

$$\text{POF} \equiv \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0].$$

### **q2** Using the observations in `df_samples` and the structural model `g_break()`, estimate the probability of failure.

*Hint*: In `c07-monte-carlo` you learned how to estimate a probability
as the `mean()` of an indicator. Use the same strategy here.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure; i.e. POF = Pr[g <= 0]
df_samples
```

**Observations**:


-   Does this estimate satisfy `POF < 0.03`?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Is this estimate of the probability of failure trustworthy? Why or
    why not?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not.

## Material property model

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Since we have so few physical samples, we will fit a distribution to
model the material property. This will give us the means to draw
"virtual samples" and use those to estimate the POF.

### **q3** Fit a lognormal distribution to the strength data using the `fitdistr()` function.

*Note*: In this challenge I generated the `strength` data from a
`lognormal` distribution; if you didn't know that fact, then the choice
of distribution would be an *additional* source of uncertainty!

*Hint 1*: We learned how to do this in `e-stat08-fit-dist`.

*Hint 2*: The `fitdistr` function uses `densfun = "lognormal"` to
specify a lognormal distribution.

```{r q3-task}
## TODO:
df_fit <- NA
df_fit
```

Once you've successfully fit a model for the strength, you can estimate
the probability of failure by drawing samples from the fitted
distribution.

### **q4** Complete the code below by 1. choosing a Monte Carlo sample size `n_monte_carlo`, 2. extracting the estimated parameters from q3, and 3. computing the limit state value `g = g_break()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

*Hint 1*: You will need to combine ideas from `c07-monte-carlo` and
`e-stat08-fit-dist` in order to complete this task.

*Hint 2*: The function `rlnorm()` will allow you to draw samples from a
lognormal distribution.

```{r q4-task}
## TODO 1: Choose Monte Carlo sample size
n_monte_carlo <- NA_real_

## TODO 2: Extract parameter estimates from df_fit
strength_meanlog <- NA_real_
strength_sdlog <- NA_real_

# Generate samples
df_norm_sim <-
  tibble(strength = rlnorm(n_monte_carlo, strength_meanlog, strength_sdlog)) %>%
## TODO 3: Compute structural response
  glimpse()

## NOTE: The following code estimates the POF and a 95% confidence interval
df_norm_pof <-
  df_norm_sim %>%
  mutate(stat = g <= 0) %>%
  summarize(
    pof_est = mean(stat),
    se = sd(stat) / sqrt(n_monte_carlo)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    pof_lo = pof_est - 1.96 * se,
    pof_hi = pof_est + 1.96 * se
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(pof_lo, pof_est, pof_hi)

df_norm_pof
```


-   Assuming your scopus is the probability of failure `POF` defined
    above, does your estimate exhibit real variability, induced
    variability, or both?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Does this confidence interval imply that `POF < 0.03`?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Compare this probability with your estimate from q2; is it more or
    less trustworthy?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
    from the *Monte Carlo approximation*? Why or why not?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
    from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
    -   (Your response here)
-   What could you do to tighten up the confidence interval?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Can you *confidently* conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?

## A different way to compute the POF

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Monte Carlo is a *general* way to estimate probabilities, but it
introduces approximation error. It turns out that, for the simple
problem we're studying, we can compute the probability directly using
the CDF. Note that for our structural safety problem, we have

$$\text{POF} = \mathbb{P}[g \leq 0] = \mathbb{P}[S \leq L / A] = \text{CDF}_S(L/A).$$

Since
`S = rlnorm(n, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`, we
can use `plnorm` to compute the probability of failure without Monte
Carlo as
`POF = plnorm(L/A, meanlog = strength_meanlog, sdlog = strength_sdlog)`.
Let's combine this idea with the fitted distribution to estimate the
POF.

### **q5** Finish the following function by computing the POF with `plnorm()`. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q5-task}
## TODO: Complete the function below;
##       note that you only need to edit the TODO section

estimate_pof <- function(df) {
  ## Fit the distribution
  df_fit <-
    df %>%
    pull(strength) %>%
    fitdistr(densfun = "lognormal") %>%
    tidy()

  ## Extract the parameters
  strength_meanlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "meanlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)
  strength_sdlog <-
    df_fit %>%
    filter(term == "sdlog") %>%
    pull(estimate)

## TODO: Estimate the probability of failure using plnorm
  pof_estimate <- NA

  ## NOTE: No need to edit; this last line returns your pof_estimate
  pof_estimate
}

## NOTE: No need to edit; test your function
df_samples %>% estimate_pof()
```

**Observations**:


-   How does this estimate compare with your Monte Carlo estimate above?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
    approximation*? Why or why not?
    -   (Your response here)
-   With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *Monte Carlo
    approximation* be induced or real?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Does this estimate have any uncertainty due to *limited physical
    tests*? Why or why not?
    -   (Your response here)
-   With the scopus as the `POF`, would uncertainty due to *limited
    physical tests* be induced or real?

## Quantifying sampling uncertainty

<!-- --------------------------------------- -->

Using `plnorm()` gets rid of Monte Carlo error, but we still have
uncertainty due to limited physical testing. Often we can use a CLT
approximation to construct a confidence interval. However, with
`plnorm()` we can't use a CLT approximation because it does not follow
the assumptions of the central limit theorem (it's not a sum of iid
random variables). Instead, we can use the *bootstrap* to approximate a
confidence interval via resampling.

### **q6** The code below estimates a bootstrap CI on your POF estimate. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q6-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
tidycustom <- function(est) {tibble(term = "pof", estimate = est)}

df_samples %>%
  bootstraps(times = 1000) %>%
  mutate(
    estimates = map(
      splits,
      ~ analysis(.x) %>% estimate_pof() %>% tidycustom()
    )
  ) %>%
  int_pctl(estimates)
```

**Observations**:


-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
    from *Monte Carlo approximation* of the POF? Why or why not?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Does the confidence interval above account for uncertainty arising
    from *limited physical tests* (`df_samples`)? Why or why not?
    -   (Your response here)
-   Can you confidently conclude that `POF < 0.03`? Why or why not?
