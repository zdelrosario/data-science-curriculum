# Setup: RStudio Shortcuts

*Purpose*: Your ability to get stuff done is highly dependent on your fluency
with your tools. One aspect of fluency is knowing and *using* keyboard
shortcuts. In this exercise, we'll go over some of the most important ones.

*Reading*: [Keyboard shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts); [Code Chunk Options](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)

*Note*: Use this reading to look up answers to the questions below. Rather than *memorizing* this information, I recommend you download a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/rstudio-ide.pdf), and either print it out or save it in a convenient place on your computer. Get used to referencing your cheatsheets while doing data science---practice makes perfect!
- If this link is broken, try searching "Rstudio IDE cheatsheet" on the web.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### __q1__ What do the following keyboard shortcuts do?

* Within the script editor or a chunk

    * `Alt` + `-`


    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `M`


    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`


    * `F1` (Note: on a Mac you need to press `fn` + `F1`)


	* `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C`



* Within R Markdown

    * `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Alt` + `I`


* Within a chunk

    * `Shift` + `Cmd/Ctrl` + `Enter`


    * `Ctrl` + `I` (`Cmd` + `I`)


Try this below!

```{r}
## Re-indent these lines
c(
  "foo",
    "bar",
      "goo",
        "gah"
)
```


### __q2__ For a chunk, what header option do you use to

* Run the code, don't display it, but show its results?


* Run the code, but don't display it or its results?


### __q3__ How do stop the code in a chunk from running once it has started?


### __q4__ How do you show the "Document Outline" in RStudio?

*Hint*: Try googling "rstudio document outline"
