# Stats: Randomization

*Purpose*: You've probably heard that a "control" is important for doing science. If you're lucky, you may have also heard about randomization. These two ideas are the *backbone* of sound data collection. In this exercise, you'll learn the basics about how to plan data collection.

**This is probably __the most important__ lesson in this entire class,** so I hope you do this exercise very carefully!

*Reading*: (None, this is the reading)

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)

## NOTE: Don't edit this; this sets up the example
simulate_yield <- function(v) {
  ## Check assertions
  if (length(v) != 6) {
    stop("Design must be a vector of length 6")
  }
  if (length(setdiff(v, c("T", "C")) != 0)) {
    stop("Design must be a vector with 'T' and 'C' characters only")
  }
  if (length(setdiff(c("T", "C"), v)) > 0) {
    stop("Design must contain at least one 'T' and at least one 'C'")
  }
  ## Simulate data
  tibble(condition = v) %>%
    mutate(
      condition = fct_relevel(condition, "T", "C"),
      plot = row_number(),
      yield = if_else(condition == "T", 1, 0) + plot / 3 + rnorm(n(), mean = 1, sd = 0.5)
    )
}
```

## An Example: Fertilizer and Crop Yield

It's difficult to explain the ideas behind data collection without talking about data to collect, so let's consider a specific example:

Imagine we're testing a fertilizer, and we want to know how much it affects the yield of a specific crop. We have access to a farm, which we section off into six plots. In order to determine the effect the fertilizer has, we need to add fertilizer to some plots, and leave other plots without fertilizer (to serve as a comparison). In scientific jargon, these choices are referred to as the "treatment" and "control". The treatment will have the effect we wish to study, while the control serves as a baseline for a meaningful (quantitative) comparison.

The code below selects a simple arrangement of treatment and control plots.

```{r define-design}
## Define the sequence of treatment (T) and control (C) plots
experimental_design <- c("T", "T", "T", "C", "C", "C")
```

In statistics, the word "design" refers to the "design of *data collection*". The purposeful planning of data collection is called *statistical design of experiments*.

## Visualize the Scenario

The following code visualizes the scenario: how experimental conditions are arranged spatially on our test farm.

```{r vis-design}
tibble(
  condition = experimental_design,
  plot = 1:length(experimental_design)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(plot, 1)) +
  geom_label(
    aes(label = condition, fill = condition),
    size = 10
  ) +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:6) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    x = "Plot of Land",
    y = NULL
  )
```

Now let's simulate the results of the experiment!

### __q1__ Simulate the results of this experimental design, and answer the questions under *Observations* below.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Do not edit; run the following code, answer the questions below
## For reproducibility, set the seed
set.seed(101)
## Simulate the experimental yields
experimental_design %>%
  simulate_yield() %>%
  ## Analyze the data
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarize(
    yield_mean = mean(yield),
    yield_sd = sd(yield)
  )
```

*Observations*

- Which experimental condition do you *expect* to have greater yield? The Treatment `T` or Control `C`?
  - (Your response here)
- Which experimental condition do your results suggest has a higher mean yield? The Treatment `T` or Control `C`?
  - (Your response here)
- The true difference between the treatment mean and control mean is such that the treatment yield should be `1` unit higher. How does your difference compare with that difference?
  - (Your response here)

## Confound - Increased yield due to proximity to the river!

What I didn't tell you about the experimental setup is that there's a *river* on the right-hand-side of the plots:

```{r vis-design-river}
tibble(
  condition = experimental_design,
  plot = 1:length(experimental_design)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(plot, 1)) +
  geom_label(
    aes(label = condition, fill = condition),
    size = 10
  ) +
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = 7,
    color = "cornflowerblue",
    size = 8
  ) +
  annotate(
    "text",
    x = 6.7, y = 1.25, label = "River",
    hjust = 1
  ) +

  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:6) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL, limits = c(0.5, 1.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    x = "Plot of Land",
    y = NULL
  )
```

While fertilizer leads to an increase in crop yield, additional water also leads to a higher crop yield. These are the only plots we have available for planting, and it's too expensive to move the river, so we'll have to figure out how to place the plots to deal with this experimental reality.

Terminology: When there are other factors present in an experiment affecting our outcome of interest, we call those factors *confounds*. When we don't know that a confound exists, it is sometimes called a *lurking variable* (Joiner 1979).

### __q2__ Try defining a different order of the plots to overcome the confound (river).

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Define your own experimental design
your_design <- NA_character_

## NOTE: No need to edit; use this to simulate your design
your_design %>%
  simulate_yield() %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarize(
    yield_mean = mean(yield),
    yield_sd = sd(yield)
  )
```

*Observations*

- Which experimental condition do your results suggest has a higher mean yield? The Treatment `T` or Control `C`?
  - (Your response here)
- The true difference between the treatment mean and control mean is such that the treatment yield should be `1` unit higher. How does your difference compare with that difference?
  - (Your response here)
- What effects are you seeing? The effect of the Treatment `T` *only*, or the combined effects of the Treatment and the river? How does this affect your estimate of the effect of the treatment?
  - (Your response here)

## Randomization to the rescue!

To recap: We're trying to accurately estimate the effect of the treatment over the control. However, there is a river that tends to increase the yield of plots nearby. The only thing we can affect in our data collection is where to place the treatment and control plots.

You might be tempted to try to do something "smart" to cancel out the effects of the river (such as alternate the order of `T` and `C`). While that might work for this specific example, in real experiments there are often many different confounds with all sorts of complicated effects on the quantity we seek to study. What we need is a *general-purpose* way to do statistical design of experiments that can deal with *any* kind of confound.

To that end, **the gold-standard for dealing with confounds is to *randomize* our data collection**.

The `sample()` function will randomize the order of a vector, as the following code shows.

```{r randomize}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
## Start with a simple arrangement
experimental_design %>%
  ## Randomize the order
  sample()
```

If we randomize the order of treatment and control plots, then we *transform* the effects of the river (and any other confounds) into a random effect.

### __q3__ Randomize the run order to produce your design. Answer the questions under *Observations* below.

```{r q3-task}
## TODO: Complete the code below
## Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(101)

## Simulate the experimental results
experimental_design %>%
  ## TODO: Randomize the plot order
  simulate_yield() %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarize(
    yield_mean = mean(yield),
    yield_sd = sd(yield)
  )
```

*Observations*

- Which experimental condition do you find has a higher mean yield? The Treatment `T` or Control `C`?
  - (Your response here)
- Since you've randomized the conditions, will the confound (river) have a *consistent* effect on the outcome?
  - (Your response here)
- The true difference between the treatment mean and control mean is one unit. How does your difference compare with that value?
  - (Your response here)

## Why does randomization work?

Let's visually compare a naive (sequential) design with a randomized design, and draw a line to represent the effects of the river on crop yield.

```{r vis-cf}
set.seed(101)
bind_rows(
  experimental_design %>%
    simulate_yield() %>%
    mutate(design = "Naive"),
  experimental_design %>%
    sample() %>%
    simulate_yield() %>%
    mutate(design = "Randomized"),
) %>%

  ggplot(aes(plot, yield)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = plot / 3), color = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_segment(
    aes(y = plot / 3, yend = yield, xend = plot),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.05, "npc")),
    color = "grey70"
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = condition)) +
  facet_grid(design~.) +
  theme_minimal()
```

In the naive case, we've placed all our treatments at locations where the river has a low effect, and our controls at locations where the river has a high effect. This results in a consistent effect that reverses the perceived difference between treatment and control.

However, when we randomize, a mix of high and low river effects enter into both the treatment and control conditions. So long as there is an average difference between the treatment and control, we can detect it with sufficiently many samples *from a well-designed study*.

It's not randomization alone that's saving us from confounds: The river will boost production for all plots, so we'll always see a yield higher than what we'd get with the treatment or control alone. Studying the difference between treatment and control cancels out any constant difference, while randomization scrambles the effect of the river. This is why we combine randomization with a treatment-to-control comparison:

- Randomization allows us to transform confounds into a random effect
- Comparing a treatment and control allows us to isolate the effect of the treatment

Using both ideas together---randomization with a control---is the foundation of sound experimental design. A similar idea---[random assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment)---is used in medical science to determine the effects of new drugs and other medical interventions.

## Conclusion

Here are the key takeaways from this lesson:

- "More data" is not enough for sound science; the *right* data is what you need to understand an effect.
- Getting the right data is a matter of carefully planning your data collection; *designing an experiment*.
- Confounds can confuse our analysis of data, and lead us to make incorrect conclusions.
  - **No amount of fancy math can overcome poorly-collected data**.
- Randomization, paired with a treatment-to-control comparison, is our best tool to deal with confounds.
