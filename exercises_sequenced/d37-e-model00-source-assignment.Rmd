# Model: Variability Quadrants

*Purpose*: All real data have variability: repeated measurements of "the same" quantity tend to result in different values. To help you recognize different kinds of variability and choose a reasonable analysis procedure based on the kind of variability, you will learn about different *sources* of variability in this exercise.

## Variability

As we've seen in this course, real data exhibit *variability*; that is, repeated measurements of "the same" quantity that result in different values. Variability can arise due to a variety of reasons, and different kinds of variability should be analyzed in different ways. To help make this determination, we're going to study a theoretical framework for variability.

## The Cause-Source Quadrants

As descrinbed in the reading, the *cause-source quadrants* organize variability into four distinct categories. Today, we're going to focus on the *source* axis, and limit our attention to *chance causes*.

- *Cause* is an idea from statistical quality control (manufacturing); a *chance cause* is modeled as random, while an *assignable cause* is thought to be traceable and preventable.
- *Source* is an idea from statistics education theory; this concept is explained further below.

## Real vs Erroneous Source

The idea of *source* can only be understood in the distinction between a *quantity of interest* (QOI) and a *measurement*: The *QOI* is the quantity that we are seeking to study, while the *measurement* is a possibly-corrupted version of our QOI. The key insight is that **variability can occur both in the QOI, and in the measurement**.

![Variability quadrants](./images/noise-v-deviation.png)

As a simple example: based on our current understanding of physics, the speed of light `c` is a [constant value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light). Therefore, any variability we see in measurements of `c` are understood to be *erroneous variability*; real variability in `c` is not considered to be possible.

Conversely, our current understanding of physics is that quantum phenomena are [fundamentally unpredictable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics), and can only be described in a statistical sense. This means that quantum phenomena exhibit real variability.

Other physical quantities exhibit both real and erroneous variability. Since the concept of a *QOI* relies on a choice, the only way we can make progress with this concept is to consider a specific scenario in detail.

## Manufacturing structural steel components

*The Context*: A manufacturer is producing cast steel parts for a landing gear. The part in question takes a heavy load, and if it fails it will disable the aircraft on the ground. These parts will be manufactured in bulk; approximately 500 will be made and installed in commercial aircraft that will operate for decades.

*The QOI*: The strength of each steel component---as-manufactured---will ultimately determine whether each aircraft is safe. As we learned in `c08-structures`, a structure is safe if its applied stress is less than its strength. Therefore, a smaller material strength is a more conservative value for design purposes.

## Scenarios

### __q1__ Imagine the manufacturer selects one part and performs multiple non-destructive tensile tests on that single part, under similar conditions. The measured elasticity from each test is slightly different. Is this variability real or erroneous?

- real or erroneous?
- (Why?)

### __q2__ Imagine the manufacturer selects multiple parts and---for each part---performs multiple non-destructive tensile tests, all under similar conditions. The measured elasticity values for each part are averaged to provide a more reliable estimate for each part. Upon comparing the parts, each averaged value is fairly different. Is this variability real or erroneous?

- real or erroneous?
- (Why?)

### __q3__ Now the manufacturer selects multiple parts and performs a destructive tensile test to characterize the strength of each part, with tests carried out under similar conditions. The measured strength values exhibit a fair amount of variability. Is this variability real or erroneous?

- real or erroneous?
- (Why?)

## Analyzing Data

The following generates data with both *noise* and *deviation*

```{r gen-data}
set.seed(101)
df_meas <-
  map_dfr(
    1:30,
    function(i) {
      Y_deviation <- rlnorm(n = 1, meanlog = 2)
      Y_noise <- rnorm(n = 5, sd = 1)

      tibble(Y = Y_deviation + Y_noise) %>%
        mutate(id_sample = i, id_meas = row_number())
    }
  )
```

`id_sample` - represents an individual part
`id_meas` - represents an individual measurement, with multiple carried out on each part
`Y` - an individual measurement, identified by `id_sample` and `id_meas`

If we make a simple histogram, we can see that the measured value `Y` is highly variable:

```{r vis-data}
df_meas %>%
  ggplot(aes(Y)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30)
```

However, these data exhibit multiple *sources* of variability. The following questions will help you learn how to analyze data in light of this mixed variability.

### __q4__ Inspect the following graph. Answer the questions under *observations* below.

```{r q4-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
df_meas %>%
  ggplot(aes(id_sample, Y)) +
  geom_point(
    data = . %>%
      group_by(id_sample) %>%
      summarize(Y = mean(Y)),
    color = "red",
    size = 1
  ) +
  geom_point(size = 0.2) +
  theme_minimal()
```

*Observations*
- Which is larger: The variability due to noise, or the variability due to deviation?
  - (Your response here)

### __q5__ Imagine `Y` represents the measured strength of the cast steel. Would it be safe to simply average all of the values and use that as the material strength for design?

- (Your response here)

### __q6__ Compute the `0.1` quantile of the `Y` measurements. Would this be a conservative value to use as a material strength for design?

```{r q6-task}
## TODO: Compute the 0.01 quantile of the `Y` values; complete the code below
# For comparison, here's the mean of the data
Y_mean <-
  df_meas %>%
  summarize(Y_mean = mean(Y)) %>%
  pull(Y_mean)

Y_lo <- NA_real_ # Complete the quantile calculation

# Compare the values
Y_mean
Y_lo
```

Use the following to check your work.

```{r q6-tests}
## NO NEED TO EDIT; use this to check your work
assertthat::assert_that(abs(as.numeric(Y_lo) - 2.0117) < 1e-3)

print("Nice!")
```

*Observations*

- How does `Y_lo` compare with `Y_mean`?
  - (Your response here)
- Would the 10% quantile `Y_lo` be a conservative material strength for design?
  - (Your response here)

### __q7__ The following code reduces the variability due to noise before computing the quantile. Run the code below, and answer the questions under *Observations* below.

```{r q7-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and answer the questions below
Y_lo_improved <-
  df_meas %>%
  ## Take average within each sample's measurements
  group_by(id_sample) %>%
  summarize(Y_sample = mean(Y)) %>%
  ## Take quantile over all the samples
  summarize(Y_lo = quantile(Y_sample, p = 0.1)) %>%
  pull(Y_lo)
Y_lo_improved

```

*Observations*

- Is the new value `Y_lo_improved` more or less conservative than the original `Y_lo`?
  - (Your response here)
- What features about the data collection / dataset `df_meas` enable the calculation of `Y_lo_improved`?
  - (Your response here)
- Measuring the strength of a part is a *destructive* experiment. Would it be possible to gather a dataset like `df_meas` in reality?
  - (Your response here)
- For what real properties (material, or otherwise) would it be possible to collect data like `df_meas`?
  - (Your response here)

*Aside*: This kind of statistical experimental design is sometimes called a [nested design](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat503/lesson/14/14.1).
