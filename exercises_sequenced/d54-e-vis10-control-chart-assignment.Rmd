# Vis: Control Charts

*Purpose*: Remember in c02-michelson (q4) when you studied a *control chart*? Now that we've learned about confidence intervals, we can more formally study control charts. These are a key tool in [statistical process control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control), which is how manufacturers rigorously track and control the quality of manufactured goods. Control charts help a process manager track when something has gone wrong in a manufacturing line, and are used to determine when a process is running smoothly.

*Reading*: [Example use](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/mpc/section3/mpc3521.htm) of a control chart, based on NIST mass calibration data. (Optional)

*Prerequisites*: c02-michelson, e-stat06-clt

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Control Chart: Example

Below is an example of a control chart: A control chart is used to help detect when something out-of-the-ordinary occurred. Essentially, it is a tool to help us determine when something non-random happened so we can plan a follow-up study and prevent that non-random event from happening in the future. To do that detection work, we look for patterns.

Note that two kinds of patterns have been highlighted below: an outlier that lies outside the *control limits*, and a "run" of batch means that all lie off-center (to one side of the "grand mean," the solid line).

## Control chart steps

To construct and use a control chart, follow these steps:

1. Group individual observations into consecutive batches, say 4 to 10 observations. If parts are manufactured in batches, then use those groups.
2. Take the mean of each batch, compute the "grand mean" based on all of the data, and establish "control limits" based on a confidence interval for the batch means (where $n$ is your batch size).
3. Plot each batch mean sequentially, and visually indicate the control limits and grand mean on your plot.
4. Compare each batch mean against the control limits and grand mean. Look for patterns to suggest batches where something out-of-the-ordinary happened. Some examples include:
- Batches that fall outside the control limits
- Consecutive batches that lie above or below the mean
- Persistent up-and-down patterns

If there are no coherent patterns and if only an expected number of batch means fall outside the control limits, then there is no evidence for non-random behavior. A process free of any obvious non-random behavior is said to be under *statistical control*, or to be a  [stable process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control#Stable_process).

If you *do* detect something out-of-the-ordinary, use the batch index to go investigate those cases in greater detail. **A control chart helps you *detect* when something went wrong---it does *not* tell you what went wrong.**

Like any form of EDA, it is also a good idea to experiment with different batch sizes.

## Data Preparation

To illustrate the control chart concept, let's first generate some data that is completely random.

```{r generate-data}
set.seed(101)
df_data <-
  tibble(X = rnorm(n = 1000))
```

Following Step 1, we need to assign batch identifiers to group the data.

### __q1__ Use integer division `%/%` and the `row_number()` helper to group consecutive observations into groups of `4` with a common identifier `id`.

*Hint*: Since `R` is a one-based index language, you will need to adjust the output of `row_number()` before performing the integer division `%/%`.

```{r q1-task}
## TODO: Edit the code below to create an `id` column where
#        consecutive groups of 4 rows have the same id
df_q1 <-
  df_data %>%
  mutate(id = row_number())
df_q1
```

Use the following to check your work.

```{r q1-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(
df_q1 %>%
  filter(row_number() <= 4) %>%
  summarize(sd = sd(id)) %>%
  pull(sd) == 0
)
assertthat::assert_that(
df_q1 %>%
  filter(row_number() >= 997) %>%
  summarize(sd = sd(id)) %>%
  pull(sd) == 0
)

print("Nice!")
```

## Generate Control Limits

Next, we'll use our knowledge about confidence intervals and the CLT to set the *control limits*, based on our batch size.

### __q2__ Use a central limit theorem (CLT) approximation to set 3 sigma confidence interval limits on the group mean you computed above.

*Note*: A 3 sigma bound corresponds to a coverage probability of `1 - pnorm(-3) * 2`; approximately $99.7%$.

*Hint*: Think carefully about how many samples will be in each *group*, not in your dataset in total.

```{r q2-task}
## TODO: Edit the code below to create an `id` column where
#        consecutive groups of 4 rows have the same id
X_grand <- NA_real_
X_g4_lo <- NA_real_
X_g4_up <- NA_real_
X_g4_lo
X_grand
X_g4_up
```

Use the following to check your work.

```{r q2-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(abs(X_g4_lo + 3 / sqrt(4)) < 0.1)
assertthat::assert_that(abs(X_grand) < 0.05)
assertthat::assert_that(abs(X_g4_up - 3 / sqrt(4)) < 0.1)

print("Excellent!")
```

## Visualize and Interpret

### __q3__ Inspect the following control chart, and answer the questions under *observe* below.

```{r q3-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
df_q1 %>%
  group_by(id) %>%
  summarize(X_batch = mean(X)) %>%

  ggplot(aes(id, X_batch)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = X_g4_lo, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = X_grand) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = X_g4_up, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Batch Index",
    y = "Batch Mean"
  )
```

**Observations**:
- How many points would you *expect* to lie outside the control limits, assume the data were completely random?
  - (Your response here)
- How many points lie *outside* the control limits? Is this about as many as you would expect if the data were random?
  - (Your response here)
- Do you see any coherent patterns in the points? Does this make sense?
  - (Your response here)

## Control Chart: Application

Next you will construct a control chart for a real dataset. The following code downloads and parses a dataset from the NIST website studying [proof masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_mass). These are comparative measurements between "exact" 1 kilogram masses, carried out by one of the world's most-rigorous measurement societies.

```{r read-nist}
## NO NEED TO EDIT; the following will download and read the data
url <- "https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/datasets/MASS.DAT"
filename <- "./data/nist-mass.dat"
download.file(url, filename)
df_mass <-
  read_table(
    filename,
    skip = 25,
    col_names = c(
      "date",
      "standard_id",
      "Y",
      "balance_id",
      "residual_sd",
      "design_id"
    )
  )
df_mass
```

Note that `Y` denotes a kind of comparison between multiple "exact" 1 kilogram masses (with `Y` measured in micrograms), while `date` denotes the (fractional) years since 1900.

First, try plotting and interpreting the data without a control chart.

### __q4__ Plot the measured values `Y` against their date of measurement `date`. Answer the questions under *Observations* below.

```{r q4-task}
## TASK: Plot Y vs date
df_mass %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, Y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Measurement (micrograms)")
```

**Observations**:
- These measurement were carried out by some of the most experienced measurement scientists in the world. Are professional measurements *exactly* repeatable?
  - (Your response here)
- What patterns do you notice?
  - (Your observation here)
  - (Your observation here)
  - ...

Next, prepare the data for a control chart of the NIST data.

### __q5__ Generate control chart data for a batch size of `10`.

```{r q5-task}
n_group <- 10
## TODO: Complete the following code to prepare the data for a control chart
## Batched data; edit this code
df_q4 <-
  df_mass %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(
    Y_mean = mean(Y),
    date = min(date)
  )
## Control limits and grand mean; complete this code
Y_mean <- NA_real_
Y_sd <- NA_real_
Y_g_lo <- NA_real_
Y_g_up <- NA_real_
Y_g_lo
Y_mean
Y_g_up
```

Use the following to check your work.

```{r q5-tests}
## NOTE: No need to change this
assertthat::assert_that(abs(Y_g_lo + 19.49853) < 1e-4)
assertthat::assert_that(abs(Y_mean + 19.46452) < 1e-4)
assertthat::assert_that(abs(Y_g_up + 19.43051) < 1e-4)

print("Excellent!")
```

Next, plot the control chart data and inspect.

### __q6__ Run the following chunk and answer the questions under *Observations* below.

```{r q6-task}
## NOTE: No need to edit; run and inspect
df_q4 %>%
  ggplot(aes(date, Y_mean)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = Y_g_lo, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = Y_mean) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = Y_g_up, linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Batch Year",
    y = "Measurement (micrograms)"
  )
```

**Observations**:
- Copy the patterns you noticed above down here; compare those against this new control chart.
  - (Your responses here)
- What additional observations can you make, based on the control chart?
  - (Your response here)

Remember that a control chart is only a *detection* tool; to say more, you would need to go investigate the data collection process.
