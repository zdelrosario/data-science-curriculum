# Data: Liberating data with WebPlotDigitizer

*Purpose*: Sometimes data are messy---we know how to deal with that. Other times data are "locked up" in a format we can't easily analyze, such as in an image. In this exercise you'll learn how to *liberate* data from a plot using WebPlotDigitizer.

*Reading*: (*None*, this exercise *is* the reading.)

*Optional Reading*: [WebPlotDigitizer tutorial video](https://youtu.be/P7GbGdMvopU) ~ 19 minutes. (I recommend you give this a watch if you want some inspiration on other use cases: There are a lot of very clever ways to use this tool!)

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

*Background*: [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) is one of those tools that is *insanely useful*, but *no one ever teaches*. I didn't learn about this until six years into graduate school. You're going to learn some very practical skills in this exercise!

*Note*: I originally extracted these data from an [Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/05/13/the-spread-of-covid-has-caused-a-surge-in-american-meat-prices) article on American meat prices and production in 2020.

## Setup

### __q1__ Get WebPlotDigitizer.

Go to the [WebPlotDigitizer](https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) website and download the desktop version (matching your operating system).

*Note*: On Mac OS X you may have to open `Security & Privacy` in order to launch WebPlotDigitizer on your machine.

## Extract

### __q2__ Extract the data from the following image:

![Beef production](./images/beef_production.png)

This image shows the percent change in US beef production as reported in this [Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/05/13/the-spread-of-covid-has-caused-a-surge-in-american-meat-prices) article. We'll go through extraction step-by-step:

1. Click the `Load Image(s)` button, and select `./images/beef_production.png`.

![Load image](./images/e-data14-load-image.png)
2. Choose the `2D (X-Y) Plot` type.

3. Make sure to *read these instructions*!

4. Place the four control points; it doesn't matter what *precise* values you pick, just that you know the X values for the first two, and the Y values for the second two.

*Note*: Once you've placed a single point, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to make *micro adjustments* to the point; this means *you don't have to be super-accurate* with your mouse. Use this to your advantage!

5. *Calibrate* the axes by entering the X and Y values you placed. Note that you can give decimals, dates, times, or exponents.

6. Now that you have a set of axes, you can *extract* the data. This plot is fairly high-contrast, so we can use the *Automatic Extraction* tools. Click on the `Box` setting, and select the foreground color to match the color of the data curve (in this case, black).

7. Once you've selected the box tool, draw a rectangle over an area containing the data. Note that if you cover the labels, the algorithm will try to extract those too!

8. Click the `Run` button; you should see red dots covering the data curve.

9. Now you can save the data to a file; make sure the dataset is selected (highlighted in orange) and click the `View Data` button.

![Load image](./images/e-data14-view-data.png)
10. Click the `Download .CSV` button and give the file a sensible name.

Congrats! You just *liberated* data from a plot!

### __q3__ Extract the data from the following plot. This will give you price data to compare against the production data.

![Beef price](./images/beef_price.png)

## Use the extracted data

### __q4__ Load the price and production datasets you extracted. Join and plot price vs production; what kind of relationship do you see?

```{r q4-task}
## TODO: Load the data you extracted above
df_price <- NA
df_production <- NA
```

**Observations**:

- What relationship do you see between price and production levels?
- Does that relationship change over time?
