# Vis: Bar Charts

*Purpose*: *Bar charts* are a key tool for EDA. In this exercise, we'll learn how to construct a variety of different bar charts, as well as when---and when *not*---to use various charts.

*Reading*: (None, this is the reading)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r library}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Two types of bar chart

There are two geometries in ggplot that will make a bar chart:

- `geom_bar()` is used for counting. It takes the `x` aesthetic *only*.

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
tibble(a = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a)) +
  geom_bar()
```

- `geom_col()` is used to show `x, y` pairs. It requires both an `x` and `y` aesthetic.

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 3),
  b = c(3, 1, 2)
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b)) +
  geom_col()
```

`geom_bar()` effectively counts the number of rows belonging to each unique value of the `x` aesthetic. We can do a *manual* `geom_bar()` by using the `count()` function:

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
tibble(a = c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)) %>% 
  count(a) %>% # Count adds the column `n` of counts
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = n)) +
  geom_col()
```

### __q1__ Convert this plot

Convert the following `geom_bar()` plot into the same visual using `geom_col()`.

```{r q1-task}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(trans)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## Fundamentals of the bar chart

There are some common properties of *all* bar charts:

- Values are shown with *bars*
  - The top of the bar is the data value
  - The bottom of the bar is at zero
- The data must be 1:1
  - That is, for each value of the `x` aesthetic, there is only one value of the `y` aesthetic*
  
The requirement of 1:1 data is really important! Look at what happens if we try to plot data that is *not* 1:1:

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 2), # Note that our x aesthetic (a) has repeat values
  b = c(3, 1, 2)  # Hence, we have two different b values for a == 2
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b)) +
  geom_col()
```

It's hard to tell what's happening, but the bars for `a == 2` are *stacked*. But if we try to interpret this plot, it seems like `b == 3` when `a == 2`, which is not true.

*There's an exception when we have additional aesthetics such as `fill` or `color`.

For the `mpg` dataset, we can see that the pairs `cty, hwy` clearly don't have this one-to-one property:

```{r mpg-not-1-to-1}
## NOTE: Run this chunk for an illustration
mpg %>% filter(cty == 20)
```

### __q2__ Inspect this plot

The following code attempts to visualize `cty, hwy` from `mpg` using `geom_col()`. There's something fishy about the `hwy` values; answer the questions below.

*Hint*: Try adding the `position = "dodge"` argument to `geom_col()`.

```{r q2-task}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_col()
```

## Stacked bar charts

We can make stacked bar charts *less* terrible by using a third aesthetic to disambiguate the bar segments. For instance,

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 2),
  b = c(3, 1, 2),
  c = c("a", "a", "b")
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b, fill = c)) +
  geom_col()
```

Stacked bar charts have their uses, but it's usually better to find a different way to show this kind of data. In particular, comparing *within* a stack is difficult, since the bars do not all start at zero. One way to make comparisons easier is to *dodge* the bars, so they all start at zero. We can do this with the `position = "dodge"` argument:

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 2),
  b = c(3, 1, 2),
  c = c("a", "a", "b")
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b, fill = c)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

Note that this naturally "shrinks" some of the bars so we can fit them near the same value. Don't mistake these bars as belonging to other `a` values (like 1.75, 2.25)---this is just an artifact of the dodging.

Note that we need to put the `position = "dodge"` argument inside the relevant geometry, and not, say, `ggplot()`.

### __q3__ Compare these plots

The following are two different visualizations of the `mpg` dataset. Document your observations between the `v1` and `v2` visuals. Then, determine which---`v1` or `v2`---enabled you to make more observations. What was the difference between the two visuals?

```{r q4-v1}
## TODO: Run this code without changing, describe your observations on the data
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = class, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**Observations**:
- Write your observations here!

```{r q4-v2}
## TODO: Run this code without changing, describe your observations on the data
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(class, fill = drv)) +
  geom_bar()
```

**Observations**:
- Write your observations here!

**Compare `v1` and `v2`**:

- Which visualization---`v1` or `v2`---enabled you to make more observations?
- What was the difference between `v1` and `v2`?

### __q4__ Fix this plot

The following code has a bug; it does not do what its author intended. Identify and fix the bug. What does the resulting graph tell you about the relation between `manufacturer` and `class` of cars in this dataset?

*Note*: I use a `theme()` call to rotate the x-axis labels. We'll learn how to do this in a future exercise.

```{r q4-task}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = manufacturer, fill = class), position = "dodge") +
  geom_bar() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 0))
```

## A bit on facets

Sometimes there's just too much data to fit a set of bars on one chart. In this case, it can be wise to separate the plot into a set of *small multiples*, often by grouping the data on a third (or fourth) variable.

For small multiples, we can use the functions `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`. `facet_wrap()` takes just one variable,

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 1, 2),
  b = c(3, 1, 2, 2),
  c = c("a", "a", "b", "b")
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~c)
```

`facet_grid()` allows us to specify a column for horizontal and/or vertical faceting, so we can provide up to two. Here's a lineup of examples:

```{r}
## NOTE: Do not edit this
# Horizontal facets
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 1, 2),
  b = c(3, 1, 2, 2),
  c = c("a", "a", "b", "b")
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(~c)
# Vertical facets
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 1, 2),
  b = c(3, 1, 2, 2),
  c = c("a", "a", "b", "b")
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(c ~ .)
# Two-way faceting
tibble(
  a = c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2),
  b = c(3, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1),
  c = c("a", "a", "b", "b", "a", "a"),
  d = c("a", "a", "a", "a", "b", "b")
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = a, y = b)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_grid(c ~ d)
```

In general, if you have just one variable to facet on, you can use `facet_wrap()` as a default. If you want more control and options over your faceting, use `facet_grid()`. We'll talk more about facets in a future exercise.

### __q5__ Improve this plot

The following graph is hard to read. Experiment with other choices of faceting to make the visual more convenient to read.

```{r q5-task}
mpg %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = cyl)) +
  geom_bar() +
  facet_grid(~ manufacturer)
```
