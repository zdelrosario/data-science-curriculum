# Stats: EDA Basics

*Purpose*: *Exploratory Data Analysis* (EDA) is a __crucial__ skill for a practicing data scientist. Unfortunately, much like human-centered design EDA is hard to teach. This is because EDA is **not** a strict procedure, so much as it is a **mindset**. Also, much like human-centered design, EDA is an *iterative, nonlinear process*. There are two key principles to keep in mind when doing EDA:

- 1. Curiosity: Generate lots of ideas and hypotheses about your data.
- 2. Skepticism: Remain unconvinced of those ideas, unless you can find credible
  patterns to support them.

Since EDA is both *crucial* and *difficult*, we will practice doing EDA *a lot* in this course!

*Reading*: (None, this is the reading)

*Note*: This exercise will consist of interpreting pre-made graphs. You can run the whole notebook to generate all the figures at once. Just make sure to do all the exercises and write your observations!

### __q0__ Simple checks

Remember from `e02-data-basics` there were *simple checks* we're supposed to do? Do those simple checks on the diamonds dataset below.

I'm going to walk you through a train of thought I had when studying the diamonds dataset.

There are four standard "C's" of [judging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_(gemstone)) a diamond.[1] These are `carat, cut, color` and `clarity`, all of which are in the `diamonds` dataset.

## Hypothesis 1

**Here's a hypothesis**: `Ideal` is the "best" value of `cut` for a diamond.
Since an `Ideal` cut seems more labor-intensive, I hypothesize that `Ideal` cut
diamonds are less numerous than other cuts.

### __q1__ Assess hypothesis 1

Run the chunk below, and study the plot. Was hypothesis 1 correct? Why or why not?


``` r
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(cut)) +
  geom_bar()
```

<img src="d06-e-stat00-eda-basics-solution_files/figure-html/q1-task-1.png" width="672" />

**Observations**:
- The truth is actually the opposite! `Ideal` cut diamonds are *more* numerous than all other cuts! Perhaps because cutting a diamond is easier than mining a new one, gemcutters add value to a diamond by striving for an ideal cut.

## Hypothesis 2

**Another hypothesis**: The `Ideal` cut diamonds should be the most pricey.

### __q2.1__ Assess hypothesis 2

Study the following graph; does it support, contradict, or not relate to hypothesis 2?

*Hint*: Is this an effective graph? Why or why not?


``` r
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(cut, price)) +
  geom_point()
```

<img src="d06-e-stat00-eda-basics-solution_files/figure-html/q2.1-task-1.png" width="672" />

**Observations**:
- This graph is virtually useless! There is severe overplotting. We cannot tell address Hypothesis 2 with this graph

The following is a set of *boxplots*; the middle bar denotes the median, the boxes denote the *quartiles* (upper and lower "quarters" of the data), and the lines and dots denote large values and outliers.

### __q2.2__ Assess hypothesis 2

Study the following graph; does it support or contradict hypothesis 2?


``` r
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(cut, price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

<img src="d06-e-stat00-eda-basics-solution_files/figure-html/q2.2-task-1.png" width="672" />

**Observations**:
- Surprisingly, `Ideal` diamonds tend to be the *least* pricey! This was very surprising to me.

## Unraveling Hypothesis 2

Upon making the graph in __q2.2__, I was very surprised. So I did some reading on diamond cuts. It turns out that some gemcutters [sacrifice cut for carat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_(gemstone)#Cut). Could this effect explain the surprising pattern above?

### __q3__ Assess hypothesis 2

Study the following graph; does it support a "carat over cut" hypothesis? How might this relate to price?

*Hint*: The article linked above will help you answer these questions!


``` r
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(cut, carat)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

<img src="d06-e-stat00-eda-basics-solution_files/figure-html/q2.3-task-1.png" width="672" />

**Observations**:
- The median of `Ideal` diamonds is a fair bit lower in `carat` than other cuts. This provides some evidence that gemcutters trade `cut` for `carat`.
- The very largest `carat` diamonds tend to be of `Fair` cut; this makese sense, as cutting the gemstone will only reduce weight.
- It seems that many diamond purchasers are more interested in carat than fine cut. This provides some rationale for why `Ideal` diamonds are cheaper; they are necessarily lower-carat.

Note what we just did:

- **We came up with hypotheses / questions about the data.**
- **We used multiple graphs to assess these hypotheses / questions.**
- **We used knowledge about the real world to make sense of the data.**

These are some of the core "moves" of exploratory data analysis.
